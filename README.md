#### Telecom Churn Case Study
### Understanding and Defining Churn
There are two main models of payment in the telecom industry - postpaid (customers pay a

monthly/annual bill after using the services) and prepaid (customers pay/recharge with a

certain amount in advance and then use the services).In the postpaid model, when customers

want to switch to another operator, they usually inform the existing operator to terminate the

services, and we directly know that this is an instance of churn.However, in the prepaid model,

customers who want to switch to another network can simply stop using the services without

any notice, and it is hard to know whether someone has actually churned or is simply not

using the services temporarily (e.g. someone may be on a trip abroad for a month or two and

then intend to resume using the services again).Thus, churn prediction is usually more critical

(and non-trivial) for prepaid customers, and the term ‘churn’ should be defined carefully. Also,

prepaid is the most common model in India and southeast Asia, while postpaid is more

common in Europe in North America.
